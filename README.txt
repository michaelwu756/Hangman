This code plays hangman for the UPE induction challenge. It uses a dictionary to
try to match possible valid words.  To compile, run 'make all'. To run, do 'make
run'. Note that there is also a jar file that can be run with 'make runJar', or
'java -jar Hangman.jar' if you do not have make installed. After running, type
in 'play' and enter the number of games to play.  The code generates a new game
at 1 guess left to prevent losing.
